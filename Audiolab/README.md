# Audiolab
A space for the development of audio-related tools.

## Next Steps
- I guess you just can't name modules in a package the name of
the package... that sucks.
- A bit of restructuring for 
- Seaborn
- open a github issue for only mono support (based on the fact
that librosa only supports mono)

---

#### Other Tasks
- `autorepitch()` should be able to take filepaths or arrays
- So... unit tests, huh. Say the *autorepitch* folder (soon to be package)
is just `autorepitch.py` & `run.py`...   I'd think there should
also be a `unit_test.py` & so on.
