# Audiolab
A space for the development of audio-related tools.

## autorepitch
Takes an audio sample and generates pitch-shifted samples
from that sample, within a range of notes specified by the user.
It was developed to aid in the process of creating soundfont files
from an audio sample. Can be used with the GUI or by calling the
function in the shell.

Here is a demonstration of the autorepitch GUI:
